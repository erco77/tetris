# tetris
Text console version of Tetris I wrote back in 1992 for IBMPC/SGI that works on VT100 + Wyse terminals. Ported to linux.

To build the program (assumes you have the gcc compiler installed):

        make
        
To run the game:

        ./tetris

Here's a sample game play screen, shown running in ![cool retro terminal](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term):
